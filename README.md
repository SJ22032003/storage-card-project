# Storage Card Project

This is a small project designed to teach students about the use of local storage and session storage in web development.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: This file contains all the styles used in this project.
- `script.js`: This is where all the JavaScript code resides. It handles storing and retrieving user information from local storage.

## How it Works

When the page is loaded, the script checks if there is any user information stored in local storage. If there is, it retrieves this information and displays it on the page. If there isn't, it prompts the user to enter their information and stores it in local storage.

The user can clear the stored information by clicking the "clear" button. This removes the information from local storage and prompts the user to enter their information again.

## How to Run

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
